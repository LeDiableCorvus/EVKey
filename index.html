<p>2017-08-14 - Initial front page layout pushed to the <a href="https://db4s-beta.dbhub.io">beta server</a>. Please test and report feedback. :)<br /> 2017-07-29 - The first "<a href="https://db4s-beta.dbhub.io/justinclift/DB4S%20download%20stats.sqlite">db4s-beta</a>" server is now online, which DB4S 3.10.0-beta can store/retrieve databases in.</p>
<center>Feel free to <a href="https://db4s-beta.dbhub.io/justinclift/DB4S%20download%20stats.sqlite">create an account</a> and try things out (the link in the top right of that page). :)<br />Don't store important data in it yet though, as we don't have backups set up yet.</center>
<p><br /> 2017-05-16 - Databases can now be toggled between public and private, through the database Settings page.</p>
<h2><a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"></a>Welcome to DBHub.io.</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org">DB Browser for SQLite</a> team are adding a "Cloud" storage service for people's SQLite databases. Completely optional of course. :)</p>
<p>Right now, there's nothing here. Over the next few alpha/beta releases for 3.10.0 we'll start adding features to make things work.</p>
<p><strong><em>All</em></strong> the DBHub.io code will be Open Source, likely under the AGPL3.0 license.</p>

<h2><a id="pricing" class="anchor" href="#pricing" aria-hidden="true"></a>Pricing</h2>
<p>Completely undetermined at this stage. ;)</p>
<p>The concept GitHub uses for pricing - free for public stuff, $ for private - is appealing, but <strong><em>may</em></strong> not work for databases. At least initially everything will be free (thanks Rackspace!), which should give us a start towards understanding data usage patterns. With that we can develop a workable model, though it may take a few iterations.</p>
<h2><a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"></a>Why?</h2>
<p>Although widely used, DB Browser for SQLite is developed very sporadically. The development team all have their own Real Lives&trade;, some of which include things like 3 part time jobs to make ends meet.</p>
<p>DBHub.io is an experiment to see if we can build a sustainable (Community friendly) income model, to give DB Browser for SQLite a lot more love and attention. :)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rackspace.com/cloud">Rackspace</a> are sponsoring the hosting (thanks!) for the next few months, which gives us breathing room to try things out.</p>
